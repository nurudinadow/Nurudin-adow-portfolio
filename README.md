# Nurudin-Adow-Portfolio

## Website Portfolio

Welcome to my personal website portfolio! This project is aimed at showcasing my current and future projects, providing a glimpse into my skills and experiences in the world of web development.

### Project Overview

I've developed this portfolio website to not only serve as a digital resume but also as a platform to demonstrate the projects I've worked on. The website includes sections such as "About Me," "Work," and "Contact Me," offering visitors insights into my background, featured projects, and ways to get in touch.

### Technologies Used

- **HTML:** The backbone of the website's structure.
- **CSS:** Styling to enhance the visual appeal and responsiveness.

### Key Features

1. **Responsive Design:** The website is designed to adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience for users on various devices.

2. **Project Showcase:** The "Work" section highlights my projects, each with its own image and brief description.

3. **Navigation:** An easy-to-navigate menu allows visitors to explore different sections of the portfolio.

4. **Contact Information:** Contact details and links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles make it simple for interested parties to reach out.
